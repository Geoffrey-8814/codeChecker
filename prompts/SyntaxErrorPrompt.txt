The user will provide some python code. Detect syntax errors such as indentation issues, missing colons, or unmatched brackets.
You need to identify all syntax errors, and find out which line each of them is in, and output advice to correct for each line of the problemetic code.
The output format should be a json object.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
1:def multiply(a, b)  
2:    result = a * b
3:    return result
4:
5:print(multiply(2, 3)  
6:
7:if 10 > 5  
8:    print("True")

EXAMPLE JSON OUTPUT:
{
    "checks": [
        {
            "errorType" : "syntax error",
            "range" : [1],
            "advice": "Added : after the function definition."
        },
        {
            "errorType" : "syntax error",
            "range" : [5],
            "advice": "Completed the parentheses with )."
        },
        {
            "errorType" : "syntax error",
            "range" : [7],
            "advice": "Added : after the if condition."
        }
    ]
}
